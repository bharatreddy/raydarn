Sebastien's Raytracing code adapted for pyDARN. Functionality from [DaViTpy](https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/davitpy) has also been adapted here.

The module has been updated to use [IRI-2020](https://irimodel.org/).

The raytracing methodology and implementation has been discussed in [Sebastien's dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/4d451048aa7bc1dd6cb49e0f7230d814/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750).
